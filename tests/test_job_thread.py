"""Tests for the cooperative-cancel thread job carrier (``backend.jobs.ThreadJob``).

Uses real short-lived daemon threads and ``threading.Event``/polling for
synchronization so all behaviour is deterministic and fast (no long sleeps).
Registry scenarios run through a real :class:`JobRegistry` to exercise slot
release and the ``timed_out`` close report.
