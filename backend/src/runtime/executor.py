"""Execution-only AgentExecutor boundary for the RuntimeState tree.

``RuntimeState`` is deliberately not an execution context.  An executor owns
provider/planner/tool objects and receives a node or a path as input.  This
module provides a small concrete boundary that can be adopted incrementally by
the existing runner while keeping the serialized protocol free of callbacks,
HTTP objects and secrets.
