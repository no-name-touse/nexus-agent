"""Neutral job lifecycle contract: stable public types and the Job base class.

Importing ``backend.jobs`` loads no runtime, tools, MCP, API, storage, or
third-party modules; later modules build registries, carriers, and the
runtime integration on top of these primitives without reimplementing the
state machine or the scheduling rules.
