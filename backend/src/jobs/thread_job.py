"""Cooperative-cancel thread job carrier (:class:`ThreadJob`).

A :class:`ThreadJob` runs a Python callable on a daemon thread started by
:meth:`~ThreadJob.start` and drives it to a terminal lifecycle state from that
same thread: a normal return becomes ``succeeded``, a raised exception becomes
``failed`` (formatted via the injected :class:`ErrorFormatter`), and a normal
return observed after a cancellation request becomes ``cancelled``.

The outcome contract is: **a raising target is always ``failed``, even when a
cancellation has been requested**; cancellation wins *only* when the target
returns normally and a cancel request is already recorded.  A target that
cannot stop cooperatively and instead raises is never silently disguised as a
cancellation.

Cancellation is strictly *cooperative*: the job never tries to force-kill the
Python thread.  It holds a :class:`threading.Event` that :meth:`subclass
cancellation <Job.cancel>` sets through :meth:`_request_cancel`, and the target
exits early by polling it.  Two minimal cooperative hooks are exposed:

* the public ``cancel_event`` attribute (a ``threading.Event``) the target can
  poll directly, and
* a callable ``is_cancelled: Callable[[], bool]`` injected into the target's
  keyword arguments if (and only if) the target declares such a parameter; the
  target can then accept an ``is_cancelled`` keyword argument and return early
  when it reports ``True``.

If a target ignores cancellation and keeps running, :meth:`ThreadJob.close`
waits up to its timeout and then logs a diagnostic (job id and thread
name/ident) stating the thread did not finish in time.  The job stays
non-terminal so a later ``close``/``cancel`` still works, and because the
thread is ``daemon=True`` the process may still exit while the thread lingers.
