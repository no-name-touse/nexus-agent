"""Protocol-agnostic long-lived service adapter (:class:`ServiceJob`).

A :class:`ServiceJob` adapts a long-lived external service to the ``Job``
lifecycle contract through the minimal :class:`ServiceDriver` port.  The job
launches an instance via ``driver.start()``, supervises it with periodic
health probes (``driver.check(handle)``), rebuilds it through fresh
generations when it degrades, and stops the current instance on cancellation
(``driver.stop(handle)``).  It is deliberately neutral: it knows nothing about
MCP, stdio, processes, or environments and depends only on the standard
library and the ``jobs`` package.

**Explicit boundary (do not implement here).**  Third-party MCP stdio
launchers cannot have process control and a minimal environment injected
through this interface: they need POSIX ``exec``-style process control and a
sanitised environment that ``ServiceJob`` deliberately does not provide.  A
later MCP module must implement its own controlled transport
(process-spawning, environment redaction, stderr capture) rather than reuse
``ServiceJob``.  This module implements no MCP protocol.

Lifecycle and ownership model:

* **Health is separate from job state.**  While the job stays ``running`` its
  ``health`` fluctuates between ``healthy`` / ``degraded`` / ``down``.  Health
  transitions are published through the job's state-change channel as reason
  labels (``"service_degraded"``, ``"service_recovered"``) *without* changing
  ``JobInfo.state``.  Because ``JobInfo.state`` stays ``running``, the
  registry's terminal handling (which keys on terminal states only) is never
  triggered by health churn.
* **Degradation.**  ``max_failures`` consecutive probe failures mark the
  service ``degraded`` (publish ``"service_degraded"``) but keep probing the
  same instance; a later successful probe recovers it in place (publish
  ``"service_recovered"``).
* **Rebuild.**  A probe failure *while already degraded* triggers a rebuild:
  the old instance is stopped via ``driver.stop(old_handle)``, a new instance
  is started (a new generation handle), and it is re-initialised.  Every
  generation has an independent shutdown boundary and resource handle; old
  handles are always closed exactly once on rebuild.
* **Rebuild exhaustion.**  After ``max_restarts`` rebuilds without becoming
  healthy the job is marked ``failed``.
* **Cancellation.**  :meth:`_request_cancel` stops the *current* instance.
  :meth:`ServiceJob.close` cancels and waits.  Stops are idempotent and
  thread-safe, so cancelling mid-rebuild never leaks an instance and each
  generation handle is stopped exactly once.

The supervisor runs on a daemon thread (documented daemon boundary): the
process may exit while a slow rebuild lingers, but after a terminal state the
supervisor thread has always exited, so ``close`` joins it and leaves no
dangling thread.
